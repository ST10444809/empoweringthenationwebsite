        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Mission and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            Empowering the Nation is a local South African business founded by Precious Radebe in 2018. The initiative
            stems from her personal experiences growing up, where she saw firsthand how her parents and elderly relatives
            were not given the opportunity to upskill themselves or follow formal educational qualifications. This
            inspired her to create a platform to help those from her community who face similar challenges. The training
            school provides skills development opportunities for domestic workers and gardeners, helping them secure better
            job prospects and a brighter future.
        </p>

        <h3>Services and Benefits</h3>
        <p>
            The primary aim of Empowering the Nation is to upskill domestic workers and gardeners, making them more 
            competitive in the job market. By acquiring new skills, they can offer more specialized services to potential
            employers, allowing them to command higher wages and take greater pride in their work. Moreover, graduates
            of the programs are equipped with the tools and knowledge to start their own businesses, transforming them 
            into entrepreneurs and leaders within their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Employers also benefit by having their household employees undergo formal skills training. This enables 
            domestic workers and gardeners to offer a wider range of services, providing households with more skilled
            labor and improving overall service quality. By investing in the education of their employees, employers 
            contribute to their personal growth and help create a more empowered workforce.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The training upskills domestic workers and gardeners, making them more marketable when seeking employment,
            enabling them to earn higher wages due to these additional skills. Beyond seeking better employment,
            graduates are also equipped with the skills to start their own small businesses and become entrepreneurs.
            Employers increasingly see the value in having their employees upskilled to offer more advanced services,
            leading to an overall improvement in household management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customers, whether employers or employees, can select from a variety of courses offered. They can choose
            more than one course, and discounts are provided based on the number of courses selected:
            <ul>
                <li>One course – no discount</li>
                <li>Two courses – 5% discount</li>
                <li>Three courses – 10% discount</li>
                <li>More than three courses – 15% discount</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Company Background</h3>
        <p>
            Since its inception, Empowering the Nation has successfully trained hundreds of domestic workers and
            gardeners through both the six-month Learnership Programs and six-week Short Skills Training Programs. These
            courses empower them to acquire marketable skills, making them more competitive in the job market or giving
            them the ability to run their own businesses. The six-month programs are spread across 12 weeks, while the
            short courses last six weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company is now expanding its reach by developing a web page and mobile app to promote its services. The
            platform will allow potential customers to request information, receive quotes for selected services, and
            sign up for various training programs directly online. The platform will serve both employees looking to
            upskill and employers interested in improving the qualifications of their household staff.
        </p>

        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>
            Precious understands the importance of a professional and polished look for her business. While she does not
            currently have a logo, she emphasizes that the images, fonts, and colors used on the website should reflect
            the professional image and purpose of Empowering the Nation. The branding will communicate trust,
            empowerment, and the skill-building potential the company offers to its clients.
